# DumpyBot
DumpyBot is a Discord bot with only one function: turn any user's profile picture into a GIF of Among Us crew mates.

# How To Use
- Install Python and PIP.
- Download the packages listed in [requirements.txt](https://github.com/delliott0000/DumpyBot/blob/master/requirements.txt).
- Paste your bot's token in [token.txt](https://github.com/delliott0000/DumpyBot/blob/master/token.txt).
- Run `py bot.py` on Windows or `python3 bot.py` on Mac/Linux.

# Notes
- [ffmpeg.exe](https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html) needs to be in the working directory in order for the command to run properly.
- I am not the original author of this image manipulation program. It was invented by someone else and I thought it'd be fun to scrape it into a Discord bot. Unfortunately I cannot find the original repository anymore, else I'd link it here.
